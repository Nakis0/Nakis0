### 👋 Hi there, I'm Nakis0

I am an AI Engineer specialized in designing **Cognitive Architectures** and **Agentic Systems**. My work focuses on creating autonomous software that can reason, remember, and secure itself deterministically.

---

### 🚀 Featured Work: [NotebookLM-Agent](https://github.com/Nakis0/NotebookLM-Agent)

A "Cognitive Operating System" that transforms Google's NotebookLM into a fully autonomous research agent.

- **Memory Tiering:** Implements `$S-Score$` (Importance Scoring) for dynamic context management.
- **Deterministic Security:** Shell-level hooks (Guardian Tier) to block dangerous actions regardless of LLM intent.
- **Self-Evolution:** Agents that can write, test, and improve their own code (RARV Loop).
